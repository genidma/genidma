### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Adeel Khan. I am a Canadian but I think globally. I have been fortunate to live around the around the Lake Ontario region for 25 years (as of this year). Lots to be grateful for and I have been a big fan of the library system across the region from Day 01. I was born in Pakistan and so I have seen and felt life from different contrasts. I speak fluent English, Urdu and Hindi. I can understand a little bit of Punjabi. My dream is to be a great parent, have good friends around, have wonderful experences each day and to meet friendly aliens.

- ðŸ”­ One of my core philosophy is to leave a place slightly better vs how I experienced it. I am currently working on or interested in areas related to:  Outer Space Security, Peaceful, co-operative, safe, secure and sustainable development of Outer Space for all of life, Children's well-being, Affordable Housing, Veterans Well-being, Food security, Education (including ed-tech), peace gaming, human computer interaction (and soon human and ai interaction), steps to superintelligence and setting the initial conditions right, protection of the biosphere. Over the years, I have also been educating myself on the core/basics of AI safety and security. While I do not have a functional understanding of how vectors and/or the math behind the different AI systems work (across the two plus one schools. Historical and now connectionist and combination of the two). I do and have taken an interest since the year 2016 with what different agents/actors/change-makers in the wider AI Space have to say. My influences include Ray Kurzweil and I have just started listening to Hinton. I am agnostic and care about atheists and agnostic causes. But I also like to learn from specific sources like Neville Goddard.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: Continue to learn from the books written by Steve Blank. 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on: Areas that I have highlighted.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with: Fundraising, team-building, setting the right culture and creating a great place to work.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: My fascination with Ants and insects in general, liberties/freedom/reason/basic research, personal development. Related to personal development, feel free to check out my model, titled 'Architectural Foundations for Enabling one's basics - A proposed, non-clinicians model.' https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZLAv3WT8q9p4eG98CxSYF8XbJ0a3W9Tj/view?pli=1 Overall, I consider myself a generalist who can go deeper and I know a little bit about different areas. I love Science and love listening to Scientists. I also like building models.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me:
- Active on the Maven app from March 2024 till October 14, 2024: https://app.heymaven.com/profile/8685 | Not as active since June of 2024. Found it difficult to retype my thoughts on the app (on the phone) as you cannot scroll back up. I guess, I could use the web/desktop interface. Writing, in general requires full focus, the ability to iterate upon the mechanics of your proposition, thinking and then crafting your writing that is in alignment with your core audience. Primarily, I feel that it is the mechanics and reworking the mechanics is like how Sir. James Dyson worked on the initial version of the vaccum cleaner. It is my understanding that it took 5127 major iterations for the invention to find product/market fit. So one cannot expect to write something that may be on one's mind for a single/singular iteration. All great things take time and are a labor of love. I guess I do enjoy writing and I am intrigued by the activity of Story-Boarding. I actually have these thoughts that we can Story-Board any solution or reality into existence. Including Safe Super-Intelligence. But as Kurzweil (no affiliation) once pointed out (I think in 'The Singularity is Near'), the question is one of 'who's values.'. Another reason I deleted Maven was that I wasn't able to connect with individuals on a 1:1 basis.

  - At some point a decision was made to make the very high level details specific to the work being undertaken. This includes probably 60% of the work effort undertaken, but not all for safety/privacy/security specific reasons. https://sharing.clickup.com/l/h/4-3461412-1/88677a3e84aec47
  - Shangrila-Veterans Healing Places: https://github.com/Shangrila-VHP/shangrila-vhp It looks like Shangrila-VHP is pivoting towards becoming a housing startup. If I can work with Veterans Affairs (worldwide) to have every single veteran and front-line staff under a roof that is safe in every way, then this alone would be a great service to humanity.

- As a non-scientist and current mathematical abilities at a developing level for Grade 8. The concept of wormhole physics seems very intriguing! I heard Demis Hassabis mention something similar on the DeepMind podcast (no affiliation with the individual or the organization). Seems weird to think that Space Time could be bent to the degree that enormous distances could be traversed in a fraction of the time that it would take light to travel across that distance. Around September of the year 2024, I looked up Einstein's Field Equations and as of right now, I do not have an understanding. Nor can I recall the logic that the symbols represent (even rudimentary) or even what the symbols are. I have heard that it takes another 4 or 5 years after an undergrad degree in the STEM field, to begin to understand relativity (special and general). I have some ideas on how we could at-least begin to wrap our mind around concepts. Primarily building atop the 'Feynman method' and borrowing from DeepWork via Cal Newport (plus other learnings over the years. See link to 'Architectural Foundations...' above). My abilities in Physics are developing (probably Grade 5 level). But I like thinking about Physics and there are possibly an infinite set of topics to think about and meditate on!

Cheers!
