### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Adeel Khan. I am a Canadian living near Lake Ontario for 25 years (as of this year). I was born in Pakistan. I speak fluent English, Urdu and Hindi. I can understand a little bit of Punjabi.

- ðŸ”­ One of my core philosophy is to leave a place slightly better vs how I experienced it. I am currently working on or interested in areas related to:  Outer Space Security, Peaceful, co-operative, safe, secure and sustainable development of Outer Space for all of life, Children's well-being, Affordable Housing, Veterans Well-being, Food security, Education (including ed-tech), peace gaming, human computer interaction (and soon human and ai interaction), steps to superintelligence and setting the initial conditions right, protection of the biosphere. Over the years, I have also been educating myself on the core/basics of AI safety and security. While I do not have a functional understanding of how vectors and/or the math behind the different AI systems work (across the two plus one schools. Historical and now connectionist and combination of the two). I do and have taken an interest since the year 2016 with what different agents/actors/change-makers in the wider AI Space have to say. My influences include Ray Kurzweil and I have just started listening to Hinton. I am agnostic and care about atheists and agnostic causes. But I also like to learn from specific sources like Neville Goddard.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: Continue to learn from the books written by Steve Blank. 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on: Areas that I have highlighted.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with: Fundraising, team-building, setting the right culture and creating a great place to work.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: My fascination with Ants and insects in general, liberties/freedom/reason/basic research, personal development. Related to personal development, feel free to check out my model, titled 'Architectural Foundations for Enabling one's basics - A proposed, non-clinicians model.' https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZLAv3WT8q9p4eG98CxSYF8XbJ0a3W9Tj/view?pli=1 Overall, I consider myself a generalist who can go deeper and I know a little bit about different areas. I love Science and love listening to Scientists. I also like building models.

  - At some point a decision was made to make the very high level details specific to the work being undertaken. This includes probably 60% of the work effort undertaken, but not all for safety/privacy/security specific reasons. https://sharing.clickup.com/l/h/4-3461412-1/88677a3e84aec47
  - Shangrila-Veterans Healing Places: https://github.com/Shangrila-VHP/shangrila-vhp It looks like Shangrila-VHP is pivoting towards becoming a housing startup. If I can work with Veterans Affairs (worldwide) to have every single veteran and front-line staff under a roof that is safe in every way, then this alone would be a great service to humanity. 

Cheers!
